Check out my new study project!! Dev Portfolio made it using a template as study model and using HTML and CSS tools. I had to learn a lot about operating and organizing the CSS codes to make the different (but similar) backgrounds and hover functions. I had to work with 
- Creating layouts with CSS;
- Positioning elements;
- CSS variables;
- CSS flexbox;
- CSS grid;
- Pseudo-class ;
- Pseudo-elements;
Hope you like it!
